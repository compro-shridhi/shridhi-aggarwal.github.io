            Tens of thousands of times every day we identify or recognise
            objects in the world around us. At this precise moment, you are
            looking at this book. If you raise your eyes, perhaps you can see a
            wall and windows. Object recognition typically happens so eortlessly
            it is hard to believe it is actually a complex achievement. Evidence
            of its complexity comes from numerous unsuccessful attempts to
            program computers to “perceive” the environment. However, computer
            programs that are reasonably effective at recognising complicated
            two-dimensional patterns have been developed.
          </p>
          <p class="text-indent">
            <i>Why</i> is visual perception so complex? First, objects often
            overlap and so we must decide where one object ends and the next one
            starts. Second, numerous objects (e.g., chairs; trees) vary
            enormously in their visual properties (e.g., colour; size; shape)
            and so it is hard to assign such diverse stimuli to the same
            category. Third, we recognise objects almost regardless of
            orientation (e.g., we can easily identify a plate that appears
            elliptical).
          </p>
          <p class="text-indent">
            We can go beyond simply identifying objects. For example, we can
            generally describe what an object would look like from dierent
            angles, and we also know its uses and functions. All in all, there
            is much more to object recognition than might be supposed (than
            meets the eye?).
          </p>
          <p class="text-indent">
            What is discussed in this chapter? The overarching theme is to
            unravel the mysteries associated with recognising
            <i>three-dimensional</i> objects. However, we initially discuss how
            <i>two-dimensional</i> patterns are recognised. Then the focus
            shifts to how we decide which parts of the visual world belong
            together and thus form separate objects. This is a crucial early
            stage in object recognition. After that, general theories of object
            recognition are evaluated against the available neuroimaging and
            behavioural evidence.
          </p>
          <p class="text-indent">
            Face recognition (vitally important in our everyday lives) diers in
            important ways from object recognition. Accordingly, we discuss face
            recognition in a separate section. Finally, we consider whether the
            processes involved in visual imagery resemble those involved in
            visual perception. Other issues relating to object recognition
            (e.g., depth perception; size constancy) were discussed in Chapter
            2.
